Five Essential Tools In Building REST apis
Pluralsight Author: Elton Stoneman

Apiary Blueprint
- collaborative
- support build process through api stub
- github support

Alternatives
Swagger - no separation between design and implementation, best support different platforms
RAML - design first tool

Testing api

Rest Client
Postman (chrome ext)

RESTClient(firefox)
REST Easy(firefox)

cUrl - command line tool
curl -v <url> //get verbose
curl  -u user:pass <url>
curl

HTTP(Web) Debuggers
Burp Suite : http://portswigger.net/burp
Fiddler
Charles (not free)

Packet Sniffers
Wireshark

*** HTTP ***
Caching
- http 1.0 expiration caching: fixed datetime
- http 1.1 expiration caching: lifecycle (cache-control: max-age, s-maxage) : fixed period
- useful for shared resources

- valiation caching
    etag
    last-modified


DNS - Routing System
- address book for the internet
- multi-tiered system
- cname

SSL - Encryption of transport layer
- https - 

*** Performance Testing ***
loader.io (free tier)
blitz.io (paid)
on-prem (standalone)

*** Monitoring ***
Logging
- loggly
- papertrail

Instrumentation
- New Relic
- Stackify (paid)

Diagnostic
- 

Delivery Process
Design
- collaboration, drives engagement, encourages early integration
- apiary & raml
- http caching, dns, ssl 
Build
- postman
    test api as you build
    deployment verification
    end-to-end acceptance tests
- cUrl
    standalone http stack
Test
- burp, http debuggin, security tests
- loader, load, soak, stress tests
- part of the build process
Run
- loggly, remote logging, easy filter and search
- new relic, platform instrumentation, rich analytics
