LINQ - Language Integrated Query

Linq Providers
- to sql (db)
- to entities (EF)
- to objects (In memory)
- to xml ()
- to Google
- to EBay
- to Twitter
- to ...

Linq to Objects
- working with lists
- binding data
- generating summary data
- working with strings
- working with dates
- code store in an object

Linq to XML

Microsoft Office Objects (word & excel)

Linq Syntax
- query: declarative, similar to sql statements (compiler converts to method syntax)
- method: methods
- query and method are semantically the same

Extension Methods
- can be chained together

Delegates
- delegates the responsibility for an operation to another function
- object oriented, type-safe function pointer, a way to pass a function to a parameter of a method
- defined with:
    a named method
    a delegate expression
    a lambda expression


lambda expression
- inline anonymous function
- single statement
- multiple statement
- does not require return statement
- used in delegate


Standard Set of Query Operators
- Traversal:  enumerating a collection
- Filter: e.g. where extension method
- Projection: reshape list

Deffered Execution
- linq queries are executed when the query variable is iterated over
- not when the query variable is declared

*** Sorting ***
Ordering Operators
- OrderBy
- OrderByDescending
- ThenBy
- ThenByDescending
- Reverse

*** Creating ***
Generation operators
- range
- repeat
Enumerable class methods
- not extension methods
Not Deffered

*** Comparing / Combining ***
Set Operators
- intersect: elements common to both sequences
- except: elements in one sequence not in the other
- concat: 
- distinct: unique elements
- union: all elements between sequences
extension methods


*** Transforming Projections ***
Projections
- Select
- SelectMany

Why Project?
- Limit to the needed properties
- Perform an action on the properties
- Morph the sequence elements into another type

Projects a type
- original type
- existing type
- anonymous type

*** Parent / Child Data
Parent objects each have a list of related child data, e.g. shopping cart has a set of items
SelectMany

*** Analyze Data ***
Totaling
- Sum 
Grouping and Summing
- GroupBy
    * single property: what is our receipt total vs our accounts receivable
    * multiple properties: what are our receipts over time, how overdue are our invoices
    * parent property: are we advertising enough to local business, is it worth the extra cost to sell to government customers
- Display result on WPF Chart
Mean, Median and Mode
- Average
- OrderBy
- GroupBy
